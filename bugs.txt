possible improvements:
is there a better way to choose if wa is wɔ or wæ?
add comments for ease of navigation
stress isn't quite right
ʊ always has an onset
add "finspell" for when a vowel is final
final y in long word is "ij" and "aj" in short words
all followed by vowel is /æl/, not /oːl/
do a check that changes spelling if last
V_e should be in that form if final s, with e before the s
change distribution - average of negative linear and bell curve if possible
stress should be first syllable of root
maybe add word class and affixes
nge as nzh spelling
