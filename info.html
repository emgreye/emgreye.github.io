        <h3>Phonotactics</h3>
        <p>
            All the phonotactics of the possible generated words align with those of Australian English. This is done by collecting a list of all possible
            onsets (initial consonant clusters), nucelei (vowels), and codas (final consonant clusters) of syllables of Australian English. These sections
            are then combined into a syllable, to which various phonetic processes are applied to. For instance, when a vowel is a closing glide (such as
            the vowel sounds in ride, boy or lake) and followed by an /l/ sound, a small sound (/ə/) is inserted in between. Around 100 lines of similar
            phonetic and orthographic (spelling) changes are applied. The syllable is then combined with 0-3 other syllables to create a word.

        <h3>Transcription</h3>
        <p>
            The pronunciation is transcribed with my own transcription, based on the 1997 Australian English transcription system by Harrington, Cox, and
            Evans. My transcription removes the vowels /ʊə/ and /ɪə/, as they make up two syllables worth of vowels in my accent: /ʉwə/ and /ɪja/
            respectively. I have also added the sound /ʊː/ which, for me, appears in words like "tandoor", "Kalgoorlie", and "pool". I consider this to be
            a distinct phoneme from /ʊ/, /ʉw/, and the removed vowel /ʊə/ as it can appear in the same environment as them: compare "tandoor" /tɐːndʊː/ to
            "endure" /əndʒʉwə/ and "undo" /ɐndʉw/, and compare pool /pʊːl/ to pull /pʊl/. HCE transcription also consider the vowels in "hang" and "jam" (
            among others) to be /æ/ whereas I would describe them as /e/ and /eː/ respectively. I believe these sounds, once allophones of /æ/, are now
            allophones of the phonemes found in words like "bet" and "pair". They can also appear in the same pre-nasal environment as /æ/ with distinct
            pronunciations: compare "Nan" /næn/ to "ban" /beːn/, and "bang" /bæŋ/ to "hang" /heŋ/. My other change has been to change many of the vowels to
            end in /j/ and /w/. The justification for this change is explained brilliantly in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA">this
            video</a> by Dr Geoff Lindsey. He describes these changes in relation to Southern Standard British English, but the same applies to Australian
            English.
